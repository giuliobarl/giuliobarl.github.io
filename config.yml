            Hi! I am **Giulio** 👋🏻

            I am a Ph.D. student in Energetics at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/), deeply engaged in the fascinating intersection of [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) and materials science 🔬🖥️. My research revolves around applying AI techniques to discover and optimize advanced materials for energy applications, with a particular focus on [perovskites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perovskite_(structure)) for photovoltaics — pioneering materials that hold the promise of revolutionizing solar energy ☀️.

            My journey began in energy engineering, but along the way, I developed a profound passion for materials science and the elegance of mathematical models. This passion drives my work today, where I merge computational intelligence with scientific curiosity to contribute to a more sustainable energy future.

            Beyond the lab and algorithms, I am a romantic at heart, finding joy in the arts. I cherish the power of music 🎵, both as a listener and a musician, lose myself in the pages of novels that explore the depths of human experience 📖, and find inspiration in the beauty of visual art, particularly paintings 🖌️. This blend of science and creativity fuels my perspective and keeps me inspired in everything I do.
