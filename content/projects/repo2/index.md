##### Description

This repository contains the database, documentation, Python library (coming soon), and notebooks used to build the Energy-GNoME database.

The purpose of this repository is to enable reproducibility and, more importantly, to support the continuous integration of your data points for model training, as the database is designed as a living database.

For further details, refer to the associated article.
